Structure and Purpose

This python library is intended for use with Simulation of Urban Mobility. It extends the API with the following
research in mind:

1. Vehicle routing algorithms
2. Intersection control algorithms

The library was created for simulating decentralised algorithms, but it has been designed with the intention that it can
be used to simulate centralised algorithms, as well as calculate macroscopic flows.

Structure:

sumoctrl.routing

This library relates to the rerouting of vehicles


sumoctrl.intersections

This library relates to the control of traffic lights in the network
